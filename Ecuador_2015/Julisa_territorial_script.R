## How degree of territoriality by AGCU changes across months across the whole site

## Subset just the points you've done, across the whole dataset
## e.g. BBLH_torpor <- subset(torpor, Species==c("BBLH", "BLCH")

### Percentage of total time, spent flying, hovering, perching

### Total time and Percentage of time spent in territorial behaviors- how this changes by time of day, 
#and by month

## Total time spent by other birds in different patches, across months, time spent undisturbed, 
## time spent being chased

## Degree of territoriality
## 1. Time spent in patch - more time=more territorial
## 2. Percentage of spent in aggressive behaviors
## 3. Within aggressive behaviors, length of aggrssive behaviors
## 4. Amount of time other birds are present, undisturbed by AGCU, amount of time they are chased
## 5. Degree of territoriality = time*(degree of aggression)*(amount other species are disturbed)
  # Test this against nectar available,
  # Time of day
