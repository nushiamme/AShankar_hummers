## DEE to packets of Lays chips

## Enter DEE in kJ/day
dee_val <- 136.5
#Weight of the animal in grams
wt <- 17.45
wt_kg <- wt/1000 ## convert weight to kg
Cal_kg <- (dee_val/wt_kg)/(4.184*160) ## Calculate number of kilocalories per kilogrom
Cal_human <- Cal_kg*85  
Cal_human




kJ/day divided by weight in kg (0.02kg) = 60/0.02 = 3000 kJ/kg/day
- Then divide that by 4.184 to convert to kilocalorie (aka Calories) = 3000/4.184 = 717
- Then divide that by Calories per packet of Lays= 717/160 = 4.48
- Multiply that by the weight of the human you're comparing to (85kg for Matt Damon) = 4.48*85 = 380
## A packet of Lays is 160 kcal

I'm just following these steps to convert:
  - 60 kJ/day divided by weight in kg (0.02kg) = 60/0.02 = 3000 kJ/kg/day
- Then divide that by 4.184 to convert to kilocalorie (aka Calories) = 3000/4.184 = 717
- Then divide that by Calories per packet of Lays= 717/160 = 4.48
- Multiply that by the weight of the human you're comparing to (85kg for Matt Damon) = 4.48*85 = 380
