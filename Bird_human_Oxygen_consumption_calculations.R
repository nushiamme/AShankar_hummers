# As you said initially, atmospheric air consistently has 21% O2 in today's world :)
# 
# Human tidal volume (i.e. per breath) is 0.5L. So inspired air for a single human breath has
# 0.21*500
# 105 mL of O2 per 500 mL of air.
# 
# But in a minute, humans breathe in about 6-12L of air at rest.
# There's 
# 0.21*6000 or 1260 mL of O2 in 6000 mL or 6L of (inhaled) air.
# 
# Resting humans have a a VO2 of about 3.5 mL/kg/min
# So *per kg*, humans consume about 3.5 mL of O2 per min. If we assume a 60kg human, their resting VO2 consumption is
# 3.5*60, or 210 mL O2/min, which means that when they breathed in 6L of air, the air they breathed out had
# (1260-210)/6000 or 17.5% O2.
# 
# Humans VO2 max (i.e. maximum possible oxygen consumption during activity) 
# is an average of 35-40 mL O2/kg/min for high-performing atheletes (though the highest ever measured was 92mL/kg/min)
# So per kg, the human consumes 35 mL O2 per min. 
# For our 60kg human, that's 
# 35*60 or 2400 mL/min of O2 consumed during heavy exercise.
# 
# And in the exhaled air, that's
# (1260-2400)/6000
# 
# -19% O2. Which... doesn't make any sense. But that's why your breathing rate has to increase!! 
# And it increases to about 100 breaths/ min when you exercise. So you're actually breathing in
# 100*0.5 or 50L of air instead of the original 6-12L of air.
# 
# With that new number, the inhaled air has
# 0.21*50000
# 
# 10,500mL of O2 in 50,000 mL of inhaled air.
# And in the exhaled air there's
# 
# (10500-2400)/50000
# 
# 16.2% O2!
# 
# I'm guessing that the 16.5% you found was an average over the course of a normal human day. But as you can see, it's more complex than that!
# 
# Now onto hummingbirds:
# From these two references, I'll pulling some average hummingbird tidal volume and breathing rate measurements
# https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251143060_Respiration_frequency_and_tidal_volume_in_resting_hummingbirds_during_daytime
# And Schuchmann & Prinzinger. Energy metabolism, nocturnal torpor and respiration frequency in a Green Hermit (Phaethornis guy). J Ornithol. 1988;129: 469â€“472. 
# A hummingbird's tidal volume is 0.17 mL. Let's say they're breathing at 200 breaths per minute.
# So their per minute inhalation volume is 0.17*200 or 34 mL.
# 
# Out of that 34 mL of inhaled air, 
# 0.21*34 or 7.14 mL is O2
# 
# If a 3g hummingbird is resting, its VO2 is about 0.5 ml O2/min.
# So it is consuming 0.5 mL O2 per min, exhaling air with
# 
# (7.14-0.5)/34 or 19.5% O2
# 
# 
# If it's hovering it's consuming about 2.3 mL O2/min.
# Assuming a constant (unlikely) breathing rate,
# It is consuming 2.3 mL O2 per min, exhaling air with
# (7.14-2.3)/34 or 14.2% O2
# 
# I'm not sure what exactly their breathing rates at their maximum are, 
# but from some maybe not accurate-for-hovering studies (https://www.jstor.org/stable/30152332?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents), let's say
# it's 500 breaths per min.
# 0.17*500 = 85mL of air inhaled per min.
# 
# That 85mL of air has 
# 0.21*85 or 17.85mL of O2.
# (17.85-2.3)/85 or 18.3% O2
